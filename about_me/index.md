Hi there.

Currently, I am a Web Development Instructor at <a
href="http://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive"
target="_blank">General Assembly.</a>

I am an Infrastructure Engineer at <a href="http://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>.
I work on the software systems that are shared across all of GA's products, such
as common APIs or authentication systems. I used to teach the Web Development
Immersive course here, teaching students who have little to no programming
experience over a period of 12 weeks to prepare them to enter the work force as
competent and confident junior web developers.

I was a <a href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/technology/" target="_blank">signal processing nerd</a>
earlier, and a <a href="https://physics.iitm.ac.in/program/3" target="_blank">physics nerd</a>
before that. I like playing my electric bass, recording electronic music, and
strategy and RPG video games.

If you like my work, or have any questions or comments, I'd love to hear from
you. Shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:hari.mohanraj89@gmail.com"
